# Wizard posting

The potions are brewing, the cauldrons are bubbling, and the wizards are posting.

## What is this?

A magical game where you can build your own spells and test your magical might.

Sound fun right? It could be even better with your help. I am currently looking for ideas for the main game loop. 

If you have any ideas, please open an issue with the `idea` tag.

Artists are also welcome to contribute. Contact me if you are interested.

## How do I use it?

Simple:

 - Have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed
 - Clone this repo
 - Run `cargo run` in the repo directory

And hopefully it works.

## I still don't get it

Imagine a mix between Minecraft mod `Ars Nouveau` and `terraria`.
